    <h1>Ethical Hacking</h1>

  <h3><p class="text1"></p>
    <p class="p1">Ethical hacking, also known as penetration testing or white-hat hacking, involves deliberately probing systems,
    networks, or applications to identify and fix security vulnerabilities. Unlike malicious hacking (black-hat hacking),
    ethical hacking is legal and often carried out by professionals who are authorized to assess an organization's
    cybersecurity defenses.
    
    Key Concepts in Ethical Hacking:
    Purpose:
    
    Ethical hackers help organizations find weaknesses before they can be exploited by malicious actors. Their primary goal
    is to strengthen the security posture of systems by providing actionable insights into potential risks.
    Types of Hackers:
    
    White-Hat Hackers: Authorized professionals who perform ethical hacking to protect systems.
    Black-Hat Hackers: Malicious individuals who exploit vulnerabilities for personal or financial gain.
    Gray-Hat Hackers: Individuals who may break laws but without malicious intent, often exposing vulnerabilities to improve
    systems without authorization.</p>
    
    <p>Ethical Hacking Techniques:
    
    Reconnaissance: Gathering information about the target system (open ports, IP addresses, etc.) using tools like Nmap,
    Wireshark, etc.
    Scanning: Actively probing the target for vulnerabilities by scanning for weaknesses like open ports, unpatched
    software, etc.
    Gaining Access: Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to a system, often done in a controlled manner to demonstrate
    risks.
    Maintaining Access: Showing how attackers might remain in a compromised system, which allows for further exploitation or
    data theft.
    Covering Tracks: Ethical hackers may demonstrate how attackers would cover their tracks to remain undetected.
    Common Tools Used:
    
    Nmap: A network scanning tool to discover devices, open ports, and services.
    Metasploit: A framework that helps ethical hackers exploit vulnerabilities.
    Wireshark: A tool for analyzing network traffic.
    John the Ripper: A password cracking tool.
    Burp Suite: A tool for web application security testing.
    Certifications:
    
    Certified Ethical Hacker (CEH): One of the most well-known certifications, offered by the EC-Council.
    Offensive Security Certified Professional (OSCP): A hands-on, practical certification known for its challenge.
    CompTIA PenTest+: A certification focused on penetration testing and vulnerability management.
    Legal and Ethical Considerations:
    
    Ethical hackers must have permission from system owners before testing.
    Their activities are governed by laws such as the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act (CFAA) in the U.S. or the General Data
    Protection Regulation (GDPR) in Europe, ensuring they operate within legal boundaries.
    Following a strict ethical code of conduct is critical to maintaining trust and integrity in the profession.</p></h3>
